      <h1>Website Pages</h1>
      Main page-
      The main page is the landing page for the website, it is the first thing seen. It gives a 
      brief description of the site and has buttons to navigate to the two most popular parts of 
      the site. There is both a header and footer, which remains consistent throughout the site, 
      that shows you all the other parts of the site you can navigate to.
      <br>
      Donate Page-
      This page has separated sections of information on where users can donate various things, 
      like items, blood, and money. Additionally, there is a section that contains posts about 
      items users of the site want to donate. In the donation page, users can see how to add our 
      their donation to that list of posts. The section guides the user to a page on the site 
      where they can fill out a form with basic information about themselves and their item. 
      <br>
      Map page - 
      It has a map of the UP with markers of resources. Each resource card has a title, website, 
      address, phone number, and link to get directions or view more details. Users can search by 
      zip code to zoom in on the map, and can filter by open locations. Also, they can reset the 
      map to the original view. There is a "more details of location" which contains all that the 
      marker contains, with the addition of the hours of operation as well as if it is currently open 
      or closed. The hours of operation can be expanded or collapsed by the user. There is also the ability 
      to leave feedback for the map page.
